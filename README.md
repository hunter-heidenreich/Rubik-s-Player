# Rubik's Cube Player

What is the Rubik's Cube Player?
================================

The Rubik's Cube Player is a python script written for the Drexel Music Hackathon that took place at the ExCITe Center from 1/28/17-1/29/17. It converts a face of a 3x3 Rubik's Cube into waveform data that is played over a speaker system by taking a picture of it with a webcam. The more solved a face is, the more harmonious it is designed to sound.
